**Innovative Idea**
>My First Idea

>>    Interactive Science application for students, I want to make it more engaging, almost like a video game  with different levels and  difficulties, each with an associated value of points awarded for passing the level

>>    We can have tutorials which teach information, hit next to continue the level progress
>>    Target audience: 6th-8th Grade: I don’t know that age seems super competitive and we could make that part of our application. If there's a competitive nature to the application they are more likely to play it.
