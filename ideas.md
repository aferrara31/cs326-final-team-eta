**TerraView**
>> TerraView is an interactive web application that provides students with a fun and social way to hone their science skills. This application can be thought of leetcode for science with a social media oriented twist. The user is either able to practice problems from provided cateories, or view and attempt a feed of problems solved by those they are connected with. I want to make it more engaging, almost like a video game  with different levels and  difficulties, each with an associated value of points awarded for passing the level

>>    We can have tutorials which teach information, hit next to continue the level progress
>>    Target audience: 6th-8th Grade: I donâ€™t know that age seems super competitive and we could make that part of our application. If there's a competitive nature to the application they are more likely to play it.
