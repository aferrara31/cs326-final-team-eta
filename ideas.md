**Innovative Idea**
>My First Idea

>>    Interactive Science application for students, I want to make it more engaging, almost like leetcode with different levels and  difficulties, each with an associated value of points awarded for passing the level

>>    We can have tutorials which teach information, hit next to continue the level progress
>>    Target audience: 6th-8th Grade: I donâ€™t know that age seems super competitive and we could make that part of our application. If there's a competitive nature to the application they are more likely to play it.

>>   Data: 
>>    These ideas came from the curriculum of 6-8 so its relevant to their knowledge

>>    creating conditions for seed germination and growth. 

>>    fossils that indicate a specific type of environment,
>>   anatomical structures that indicate the function of an organism in the environment, and
>>    fossilized tracks that indicate behavior of organisms.

>>    Develop and use a model of the Earth-Sun system to explain the cyclical pattern of seasons

>>    //Maybe an interesting idea I came up with
>>    We could add an exercise aspect to it, that's what could make it different from other web apps like it
>>   give free points and set a timer and have them do a simple exercise

      // Should we break the questions into categories (bio, chem, physics, geology, etc.)
