This file will detail all of the softwares this application uses, and explain their purpose, why this one was chosen, and details about how to use them if applicable

- Still might need to add Redux for state management
- Discuss if we want to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript (we don't need it since we're not working at school and the codebase won't grow too complex, but I think it could be good practice and this would be the best time to make the change if we do end up making it)
- Should set up some for of CI / CD, most likely with GitHub Actions that runs tests on a commit etc
- Should set up some templated pre commit hook / check with git conventional commits
