UI Interfaces:

Login/Registration Page:
![alt text](https://github.com/aferrara31/cs326-final-team-eta/blob/main/docs/img/LoginPage.png?raw=true)
We plan to have a linked login and registration page where users will be able to sign into their account using their email and password, or potentially linking Google, Github, Twitter, etc. as a way to log in.

The Registration page will allow people the ability to sign up for an account using their email and a password. Will need to link Google, Github, etc. if we decide to use those as means of loging in.

Learning Page:

Our idea for a learning page includes a Q and A style learning that will allow students to ask questions on the app. Those questions can be answered by the teachers or education professionals who have also signed up for the app.
