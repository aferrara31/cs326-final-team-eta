**Innovative Idea TerraView**
> TerraView is an interactive web application that provides students with a fun and social way to hone their science skills. This application can be thought of as LeetCode for science, with a social media oriented twist. The target audience is 6th to 8th grade since this age seems to be very competitive. The competitive nature of solving problems would likely draw in many users from this demographic. Another motivation for selecting this demographic is that by teaching science to this age group, many doors will open up for them. Selecting this narrow group of people allows us to provide a better solution for a specific group of people, and then once we've established a product, it would be much easier to expand the application to appeal to a wider scope of people. 

> The user is either able to practice problems from provided cateories, or view and attempt a feed of problems solved by those they are connected with. Each user will have a profile page that display information such as the number of problems they've solved or solutions from problems they've solved. 

> There will be a learning section that provides the user with information about the topics provided, and this information could be provided in a variety of ways such as infromational articles, videos, or models, such as a model solar system.

> It will be free to register for students or teachers, meaning they must provide a educational email address, otherwise there will be some form of subscription fee they must pay.
